## Issue #1 — Kernel: Edge, Graph and ImportKind

- WHY: `importKinds` is its own type `ImportKindSet` (a `uint8` bit set) instead of a list field —
  merging parallel edges is then a single `|`, and it keeps `Edge` comparable so it can be a map key,
  which is what `NewGraph` merges with.
- WHY: file stems are `edge.go`, `graph.go`, `import_kind.go`, `identifier.go` rather than the
  sibling stems listed in `AGENTS.md` (`extract_graph.go` and friends) — those name the extractor,
  which this issue does not build; these name the concepts the issue does ask for.
- WHY: identifier normalisation sits in `common/extraction/identifier.go`, not in `common/util` with
  the path helpers — the issue scopes the kernel to `common/extraction`, and identifiers must be
  minted in exactly one place, which is here.
- WHY: `Graph` is `type Graph []Edge` (a list of `Edge`, as the data model says) with the invariants
  — normalised identifiers, merged parallel edges, stable order — established by `NewGraph`/`Add`
  rather than by a struct wrapper, so downstream code just ranges over it.
- WHY: `RelativeIdentifier` does lexical prefix arithmetic on normalised identifiers instead of
  calling `filepath.Rel` — `filepath` treats `\` as a separator only on Windows, so `Rel` gave
  host-dependent answers for the same input.
- WHY: no fluent-API integration test in this issue — nothing public exists to route a rule through
  yet. The kernel is covered by unit tests against hand-built edges and a fixture graph.
